meaning flags:
TODO_CE : there is something todo for this counterexample
CE_RM : this counterexample should later be removed from this 
		testset. (e.g. because it fails pre-verification)

issues functionality:
	demos/append-sorted-error-3.rs
		there is no counterexample violating this postcondition,
		what would generated counterexample look like?

	fold-unfold/negative-enum.rs
		unregistered verification error, but still produces viper file with counterexample
		What exactly fails here? Don't know what the counterexample would be.
	
	gitlab-issues/issue-74.rs
	simple-specs/binary-search.rs
		TODO: Don't know how or why this fails, go over it again! 
		same function in both files

	unexpected behavior verification:
	fold-unfold/negative.rs
		does verify! is this in the wrong folder?

	magic-wands/wrong-wand-identity2.rs
		- identity2 actually verifies
		- identity_use3 is a good example to discuss at which program points the
		  values of variables should be displayed.

examples design decisions:

	magic-wands/wrong-wand-identity2.rs
		- identity_use3 is a good example to discuss at which program points the
		  values of variables should be displayed.

	pure-fn/integer-bounds.rs
		in u32_foo_call_4() should the counterexample display anything? like a temporary variable
		for the return value? (many other places where this question rises)
	loops/havock_loop_vars.rs
		same, the result of random() is very essential to understand a 
		counterexample so its result should be visible.
